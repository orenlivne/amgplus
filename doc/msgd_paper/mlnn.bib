	Abstract = {Humans can recognize the gist of a novel image in a single glance, independent of its complexity. How is this remarkable feat accomplished? On the basis of behavioral and computational evidence, this paper describes a formal approach to the representation and the mechanism of scene gist understanding, based on scene-centered, rather than object-centered primitives. We show that the structure of a scene image can be estimated by the mean of global image features, providing a statistical summary of the spatial layout properties (Spatial Envelope representation) of the scene. Global features are based on configurations of spatial scales and are estimated without invoking segmentation or grouping operations. The scene-centered approach is not an alternative to local image analysis but would serve as a feed-forward and parallel pathway of visual processing, able to quickly constrain local feature analysis and enhance object recognition in cluttered natural scenes.},

	Abstract = {We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.},
